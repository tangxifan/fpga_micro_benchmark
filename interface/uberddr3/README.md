## Benchmarks

Benchmarks are categorized in the following directories, depending their logic functions:

- dsp: Digital Signal Processing (DSP) -related applications
- fsm: Finite State Machine (FSM) - related applications
- interface: system bus and protocols, such as SPI, UART etc.
- processor: CPU cores
- ram: Memory blocks, including random access memories, FIFOs, etc.
- simple_gates: combinational circuits in small sizes
- simple_registers: sequential circuits in small sizes
