Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This benchmark is designed to test the flip-flop/registers in FPGAs.
It is a 1-bit clock divider, which outputs half frequency of the input clock.

Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~

Expect to consume only 1 LUT and 1 flip-flop of an FPGA.
It can reflect the maximum speed of an FPGA between a LUT and a flip-flop.
